**Step 1: 
-> command: npm init -y
=> with this command we will get a package.json file

**Step 2:
-> command: npm i express
=> we install express by npm

**Step 3: 
-> const express = require('express');
=> we require express in our project

**Step 4: 
-> const app = express();
=> Its a function, so we have to call it. And we store it in a variable.
